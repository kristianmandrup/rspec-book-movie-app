Feature: Showtime Descriptions
  So that I can find movies that fit my schedule 
  As a movie goer 
  I want to see accurate and concise showtimes

  Scenario: Show minutes for times not ending with 00
    Given a movie 
    When I set the showtime to "2007-10-10" at "2:15pm" 
    Then the showtime description should be "October 10, 2007 (2:15pm)"

    Scenario: Hide minutes for times ending with 00 
      Given a movie 
      When I set the showtime to "2007-10-10" at "2:00pm" 
      Then the showtime description should be "October 10, 2007 (2pm)"
