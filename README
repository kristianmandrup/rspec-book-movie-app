== RSpec book : Movie app for Rails 3 and Rspec 2 with Capybara

See the 'Cucumber Recipe.txt' file to see the steps I did to get it to this working stage. There might be a few minor missing steps, please let me know.
How this helps you get through... 

Gems I have installed:
cucumber (0.8.0)
cucumber-rails (0.3.2)
rspec (2.0.0.beta.11, 1.3.0)
rspec-core (2.0.0.beta.11)
rspec-expectations (2.0.0.beta.11)
rspec-mocks (2.0.0.beta.11)
rspec-spies (1.2.9)
capybara (0.3.8) 
autotest (4.2.10)
autotest-fsevent (0.2.2)
autotest-growl (0.2.4)
autotest-rails (4.1.0) 

Note:
I have yet to succeed in geting autotest to work:

<pre>
$ autotest
loading autotest/cucumber_rails_rspec2
Error loading Autotest style autotest/cucumber_rails_rspec2 (no such file to load -- autotest/rails_rspec2). Aborting.
</pre>
