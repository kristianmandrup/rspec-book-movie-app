# RSpec book : Movie app for Rails 3 and Rspec 2 with Capybara #

See the ['Cucumber Recipe.markdown'](http://wiki.github.com/kristianmandrup/rspec-book-movie-app/) file to see the steps I did to get it to this working stage. 
There might be a few minor missing steps, please let me know.
I sincerely hope this helps you and others get through the example using the latest and greatest versions of Rails, RSpec, Cucumber etc.

My gems config:
<pre>cucumber (0.8.0)
cucumber-rails (0.3.2)
rspec (2.0.0.beta.11, 1.3.0)
rspec-core (2.0.0.beta.11)
rspec-expectations (2.0.0.beta.11)
rspec-mocks (2.0.0.beta.11)
rspec-spies (1.2.9)
capybara (0.3.8) 
autotest (4.2.10)
autotest-fsevent (0.2.2)
autotest-growl (0.2.4)
autotest-rails (4.1.0)</pre>

Note:
I have yet to succeed in getting autotest to work:

<pre>$ autotest
loading autotest/cucumber_rails_rspec2
Error loading Autotest style autotest/cucumber_rails_rspec2 (no such file to load -- autotest/rails_rspec2). Aborting.
</pre>

If anyone has a solution to this, please let me know! :)
